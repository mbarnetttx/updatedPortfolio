              If you asked my peers about me, they would probably say that I am positive, resourceful, and determined. I
              was a young mother and was so proud
              when I finished college. I wanted to be a teacher. However, the cruel brutality of children was too much
              for my peaceful way of life.
              If you have someone in your life that is a teacher, give them a hug, they need it!
              <br><br>
              I dipped my toes in a few different professions after that, trying to find career paths that interested
              me.
              In the meantime, I practiced graphic design, which I studied in college as well. Most importantly, I
              helped
              to build a business and website called 512ATX, which is a "search by category" site containing almost
              every restaurant and bar in Austin, Texas.

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-12">

              I also worked on a site called Down To Fest, which sold and promoted clothing and accessories made by
              vendors in the music festival community.
              For the past 6 months, I have been working on my own site, DiscoThreads, a retail store featuring my own
              graphics. It has been my baby ever since.
              <br><br>

              When I heard about the UT Bootcamp, I knew immediately that it would help to expand my personal endeavors.
              I would love
              to be a part of a successful company, but I would like to create a company and help others achieve success
              as well.
